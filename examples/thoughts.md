What do we want to make easy?
- Dependency inversion
- Observability
- Identifying and isolating side effects and coupling
- Testing and writing clean code

What experience do we want to provide?
- Elegant but lightweight syntax like MoonScript, CoffeeScript, Nim, Python and Haskell
- Simple and fast tooling and debugging

Features that make it easier to write solid clean code
- Pattern matching
- Return early
- Unified function call syntax
- Algebraic Data Types

Some extra nice bits for familiarity:
- Standard imperative control flow
- Mutable variables
