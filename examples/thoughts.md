What do we want to make easy?
- Dependency inversion
- Observability
- Pattern matching
- Testing
- Return early
- Unified function call syntax
- Identifying and isolating side effects and coupling
- Standard imperative control flow

Some extra nice bits for familiarity:
- Simple if and for loops
- Mutable variables
