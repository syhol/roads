# A language to make it easy to write S.O.L.I.D, Observable code

What do we want to make easy?
- Writing quality code
    - Dependency inversion
    - Testing and writing clean code
    - Decoupling Domain and Infrastructure
    - Identifying and isolating side effects and coupling
- Easy to understand, write and debug
    - Observability
    - IO
    - Execution contexts

How do we avoid adoption problems
- Easy to use
- Familiar patterns

What experience do we want to provide?
- Elegant but lightweight syntax like MoonScript, CoffeeScript, Nim, Python and Haskell
- Simple and fast tooling and debugging
- Complied and interpreted

Features that make it easier to write solid clean code
- Pattern matching
- Return early
- Unified function call syntax
- Algebraic Data Types

Some extra nice bits for familiarity:
- Standard imperative control flow
- Api inspired by dart and haskell
