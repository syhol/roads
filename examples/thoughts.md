# A language to make it easy to write S.O.L.I.D, Observable code

What do we want to make easy?
- Dependency inversion
- Observability
- Identifying and isolating side effects and coupling
- Decoupling Domain and Infrastructure
- Testing and writing clean code

How do we avoid adoption problems
- Easy to use
- Familiar patterns

What experience do we want to provide?
- Elegant but lightweight syntax like MoonScript, CoffeeScript, Nim, Python and Haskell
- Simple and fast tooling and debugging
- Complied and interpreted

Features that make it easier to write solid clean code
- Pattern matching
- Return early
- Unified function call syntax
- Algebraic Data Types

Some extra nice bits for familiarity:
- Standard imperative control flow
- Api inspired by dart and haskell
